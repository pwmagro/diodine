# a physically-inspired distortion plugin

diodine takes inspiration from real diode behavior. adjust forward voltage, breakdown voltage, reverse recovery time, and ts/tt ratio. interact with a circuit diagram to change diode configuration and gain. change the color of the UI because i was procrastinating on some of the harder bits of programming.

feature requests & bugs can be shared through the Issues tab on github, or [in my discord server](https://discord.gg/KgCtPphrDd).

## the disclaimer
this is a _physically inspired_ effect, _not_ a physical model. diode behavior is complicated; diodine is a loose approximation (and decent exaggeration) of that behavior.
